#Development Notes

## Introduction
Time-tracking is a fundamental feature to a company's ability to both regulate and organize its administration and find and create opportunities to remain functional and efficient. It allows companies to, by the means of registering the times of clock-in, clock-out and other breaks or halts in work hours, keep track of working hours of its employees and processes, allowing the company to fulfill its obligations with their workers and, likewise, be able to tell if they are all fulfilling theirs.

The automation of these processes not only allows a company to be able to both attend and track said obligations with much more autonomy, but also opens room to both study its data and model and improve upon it. Being able to identify and address outliers and unexpected results can wield better results on short term which, along with the understanding and study of the current model of work processes, can allow the improvement of a company's methods to expand positive effects into long term, possibly making a better workplace environment for workers and an easier accountability for company managers.

The goal of this application, initially, is to replicate a simple model, provided by the mywork Challenge, of a business company looking for an application able to record the time-tracking of its employees via the use of 'geofences', which takes the location of a given employee during a clock-in or clock-out and validates it on the basis of said employee being inside the company's 'geofence', and invalidating it otherwise.

The challenge possess make specific goals, both in terms of meeting the needs of said company and in technical terms in terms of the tools expected to be used and express through this project, and they can be found in the Challenge.md file.
